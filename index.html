      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Oishani Bandopadhyay, currently a graduate student in the Computational Social Science MS Program at UCSD. 
        As an undergraduate at UCSD, I double-majored in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and 
        Neural Computation, and Linguistics. I'm interested in the intersections of language, technology, and perception,
        through computational linguistics, natural language processing, and applications of machine learning and data science 
        to speech and text.</p>
      <p>
        I find using computational methods to quantify biases in language technology and understand variation in speakers 
        really exciting. How LLMs and speech recognition systems vary in their responses across differences in gender, 
        language background, race, and other factors, and how we can build more equitable systems to counter these biases,
        are questions I'm frequently thinking about.</p>

      <p>
        Through research, internships, and projects, I've worked with machine learning models, data science methods, and
        agentic systems. I'm always building up my technical skills to be able to answer interesting, impactful questions.
        My interdisciplinary background encourages me to approach problems from unique angles, and never stop learning.
