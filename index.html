      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm Oishani Bandopadhyay, currently a graduate student in the Computational Social Science MS Program at UCSD. 
        As an undergraduate at UCSD, I double-majored in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and 
        Neural Computation, and Linguistics. I'm interested in the intersections of language, technology, and perception,
        through computational linguistics, natural language processing, and applications of machine learning and data science 
        to speech and text. 
      </p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>

    <p>I've worked in many interdisciplinary settings, and always come back to using computational methods and language data. 
      My CV lists my experiences and current work in more detail.</p>
